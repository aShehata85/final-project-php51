    <h1>This ReadMe file for project notes</h1>
    ================================================
    <h3>Front-End Part</h3>
    =========================
    <p>1. When using mobile vision mode burger-menu not appearing but working.</p>
    <p>2. Pictures were not the same size, so shadow-boxes not accurate in dimensions even with media query.</p>
    <p>3. new CSS items used like -writing-mode- .</p>
    <br>
    =========================
    <h3>Back-End Part</h3>
    =========================
    <p>1. I followed the sequence of loading laravel project, making controllers, models and routes.</p>
    <p>2. the challenge came when started making DB errors done fixed some through (.env).</p>
    <p>3. Issues came when migrating tables and Rolling-Back mny times without effect.</p>
    <p>4. Installed laravel/ui, and then ui bootstrap --auth.</p>
    <p>5. Then npm install && npm run dev.</p>
    <p>6. When tried to register keeps erroring.</p>
    <p>7. My plan was to use Vue.js and Link it with laravel with some API to connect however i need more training to
        fix bugs of my project.</p>
